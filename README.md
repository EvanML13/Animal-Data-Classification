# Project Summary 
This repository contains a machine-learning project implemented entirely in C for classifying animals based on a dataset of binary characteristics. The program analyzes similarity between animals using multiple distance metrics and applies a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to predict class labels and measure accuracy.

The program loads animal names, 16 binary features, and class labels from a structured text file using robust parsing, error checking, and struct-based storage. The program then computes similarity between two feature vectors using Euclidean Distance, Hamming Distance, and Jaccard Similarity. Given a new sample, the K Nearest Neighbors Algorithm computes the distance to all known animals, sorts by chosen metric, selects the top k nearest neighbors, and predicts the most frequent class label. The program also supports valuation on a separate labeled test dataset to measure prediction accuracy.
